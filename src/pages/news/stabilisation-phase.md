With the recent government's announcement for tighter measures in the stabilisation phase from 27 September to 24 October 2021, Ubin Thai Buddhist Temple will be implementing measures to minimise interaction and the risk of COVID-19 transmission among devotees.

During this stabilisation phase, devotees can participate in activities in groups of no more than 2 persons. Please expect a longer waiting time for offerings to the monks.

Thank you for your kind understanding.
